    "  - If you have a set of statements and inside there is a procedure then when it reaches that procedure it will excute that procedure and then go back to the rest of the statments.\n",
    "  - If you see a return statement you automatically end the procedure even if there is more statements\n",
    "  - Two types of procedures, one that returns a value and one that executes a block of code.\n",
    "  - The subdivision of a computer program into sepearate subprogrames is called modularity,\n",

    "  - This code would return an error because there is an unmatched curly brace and if the program did not have an error, the code would display \"the minimum number is\" because the minimum number is never displayed.\n",
