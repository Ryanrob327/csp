# Safe Computing

1. Aspects like logging in and signing up create PII in CSP
   
2. I am strongly against PII, I believe that no one on the internet needs to know anything about me except basic information like my name or email even if it is only being used to improve advertisement. it is helpful to know if your information has been leaked because you can check https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to tell

3. The best password uses multiple non-alphanumeric characters but still makes sense for you to remember it, another great idea is to enable two-factor authentication.

4. Symmetric encryption uses a unique key that must be shared between the people who need to receive the message, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public keys and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when they are communicated.

5. AES-256 is used in aws server-side encryption
 
6. Personally, I have never been affected by a phishing scheme because I never click on links that I don't trust
