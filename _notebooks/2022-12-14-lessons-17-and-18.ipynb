    "  - Problem:  description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm.\n",
    "  - Decision problem:  a problem with a binary answer (yes or no).\n",
    "  - Optimization problem:  a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem.\n",
    "  - Decidable problem:  problem for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs.\n",
    "  - Undecidable problem:  These are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Notes\n",
    "  - An algorithm's efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning.\n",
    "  - An algorithmâ€™s efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes.\n",
    "  - Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time.\n",
    "  - Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hacks\n",
    "1. Decidable problems are designed to produce an output for every possible input, and example is Linear Search. Undecidable problems cannot have algorithms be built that can produce a correct answer an example is a paradox.\n",
