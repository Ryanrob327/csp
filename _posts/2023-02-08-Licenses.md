# Safe Computing

1. Aspects like logging in and signing up create PII in CSP
   
2. I am strongly against PII, I believe that no one on the internet needs to know anything about me except basic information like my name or email even if it is only being used to improve advertisement. it is helpful to know if your information has been leaked because you can check https://haveibeenpwned.com/ to tell

3. The best password uses multiple non-alphanumeric characters but still makes sense for you to remember it, another great idea is to enable two-factor authentication.

4. Symmetric encryption uses a unique key that must be shared between the people who need to receive the message, while asymmetric encryption uses a pair of public keys and a private key to encrypt and decrypt messages when they are communicated.

5. AES-256 is used in aws server-side encryption
 
6. Personally, I have never been affected by a phishing scheme because I never click on links that I don't trust


# License

### Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal
  - Makes your work available on the public domain

### Open Source MIT License
  - Gives credit to the author(s) of the licensed project

### Open Source GPL License
  - Lets you do anything except distribute closed source software



2. Copy rights can allow people online to monetize their work and make a living for what they do without others stealing their work. However, copyright laws can be abused to steal the money from creators online that may unknowingly use copyright protected content.

3. The MIT license that we use for our project allows for open source projects, additionally, we will never make this project available to a large amount of people for financial gain so we do not need to worry about any legal implications affiliated with selling a service.
