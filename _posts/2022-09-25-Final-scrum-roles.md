# Project Purpose
## Meet college board criteria:
  - use data abstraction
  - use procedural abstraction
  - show testing

## My first idea, checkers, meets all criteria
  - data abstraction with a 2D array when loading the board and pieces.
  - procedural abstraction with how the player interacts with the screen and interacts with the pieces on the board.

## My second idea, a learning website similar to khan academy
  - great purpose.
  - needs some more thought to meet college board criteria.
