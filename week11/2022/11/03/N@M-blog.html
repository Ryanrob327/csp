<p>This was a helpful tool that allows the user to time how long they have been working and take breaks frequently. This site also allows for the user to create tasks and organize them in a helpful format. I like this site because it seems to have nice functionality and program purpose.</p>

<p>This site was an arcade site that offered a plethora of video games for the user. This site was arguably one of the most entertaining with games like snake, blackjack, joke box, and pong. Additionally, they had a voting system that accessed API in backend.</p>
