# Submissions
## Submission 1

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|0|0|program functionality and purpose are switched|
|#2 Data Abstraction|0|0|list does not show images and names|
|#3 Managing Complexity|0|0|does not explain how list manages complexity|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|0|response does not connect how procedure contributes to functionality|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|0|0|algorithm not explained in enough detail|
|#6 Testing|1|1|correctly identifies two calls and their conditions and results|

### Discrepancy
  - #4 -- I incorrectly thought that describing the procedure was enough but you also have to connect the procedure to the overall functionality of the code.

## Submission 2

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|1|1|correctly demonstrates input, output, purpose, and functionality|
|#2 Data Abstraction|1|1|correctly identifies data being stored in a list, name of the list, and what the data represents in the program|
|#3 Managing Complexity|1|1|correctly demonstrates how program manages complexity and how it could be written differently without lists|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|1|correctly demonstrates both code procedures and how the procedure connects to the program|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|1|1|explains in detail how algorithm works and demonstrates key ideas|
|#6 Testing|1|1|correctly identifies two calls and their conditions and results|

## Submission 3

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|0|0|describes functionality where it should describe purpose|
|#2 Data Abstraction|1|1|correctly identifies data being stored in a list, name of the list, and what the data represents in the program|
|#3 Managing Complexity|1|1|correctly demonstrates how program manages complexity and how it could be written differently without lists|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|1|correctly demonstrates both code procedures and how the procedure connects to the program|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|1|1|explains in detail how algorithm works and demonstrates key ideas|
|#6 Testing|1|1|correctly identifies two calls and their conditions and results|

## Submission 4

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|1|1|correctly demonstrates input, output, purpose, and functionality|
|#2 Data Abstraction|0|0|does not properly demonstrate the use of lists|
|#3 Managing Complexity|0|0|uses list, list does not store data, it acts as a counter|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|1|correctly demonstrates both code procedures and how the procedure connects to the program|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|1|1|explains in detail how algorithm works and demonstrates key ideas|
|#6 Testing|1|0|response gives conditions being tested rather than arguments|

### Discrepancy
  - #6 -- I incorrectly thought the conditions being tested were the arguments in the rubric


# Reflection

Overall I think I need to be more strict, all of the discrepancies that I had with CB were from me being generous or not entirely reading the rubric. I also need to watch out for common mistakes like the program purpose describing functionality or incorrectly explaining how list manages program complexity.
