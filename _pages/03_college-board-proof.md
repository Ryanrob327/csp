# Week 6

## Problems I had
  - On question 3 I incorrectly selected D, I thought that the app would find Alejandra's location useful considering it could find a restaurant near her, personally, I think this was a bad question but maybe I am just salty.
  - On question 5 I incorrectly answered A, the difference was that one answer talks about iterating through all elements and the other talks about iterating through all subsequent elements.

  - On question 3 I incorrectly selected D, I thought that the values of J and K are replaced but they are actually copied.
