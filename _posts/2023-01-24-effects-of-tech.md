## Communication

Modern technology allows people to communicate with each other instantly, be it through calls, text, email, or the internet. This is helpful when you are scientists working from different countries on the same project, a person who works from home, or rescue personnel in a natural disaster situation. However instant communication may not always be such a good thing, one negative is cyber bullying, often young impressionable people are the targets of cyber bullying

## Improved Efficiency

We can perform more tasks in less time. From shared drives to emails, communication, coordination, execution and implementation of a lot of business processes has become swift and hassle-free, all thanks to technology. However technology may also cause more stress when you are expected to do more complex work.

## Dependability

The biggest disadvantage of technology is how much we depend on it. And a minor lapse in the functioning can create a situation that cannot be controlled. So, a minor malfunction may cause a complete can cost a human life as well. For example look at the Y2K panic or the blackout across Texas

# Dopamine

The dopamine impact is a real thing, every day when I go to school, no matter what period it is, I can always see at least one person in my class on their phone, and normally it is one of the people failing the class. Addiction to your phone draws your attention away from the real world, I was there once, but eventually I learned that to combat addiction to my technology I have to set time limits, create a schedule, and step outside to connect to the real world often.
