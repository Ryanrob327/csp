# Project Plan
  - We will create a program that displays information on the stock market with graphs and tables
    - This program will take data on the stock market from the polygon.io api 
    - The information for each graph/table will be stored in a dictionary with multiple values
    - you will be able to switch between different stock options to view

# College board criteria
## 1. Program Purpose and Function
### purpose
  - Create a web application that provides data for people when investing in the stock market
### function
  - User selects what stock they want data for
  - Web application provides data in the form a graphs and a table that assist you with investing
## 2. Data Abstraction
  - We will collect data from an api in the form of dictionaries
  - The data collected from the api will be used to create graphs and tables
## 3. Managing Complexity
  - Data will be based on time(x-axis) and stock value(y-axis)
## 4. Procedural Abstraction
  - The option to choose between different graphs and data tables and see different results
  - The option to compare different stocks to another on the same graph
## 5. Algorithm Implementation
  - TBD when we go over this in class
## 6. Testing
   - case sensitive
