  <li>#6 – I incorrectly thought the conditions being tested were the arguments in the rubric</li>

<p>Overall I think I need to be more strict, all of the discrepancies that I had with CB were from me being generous or not entirely reading the rubric. I also need to watch out for common mistakes like the program purpose describing functionality or incorrectly explaining how list manages program complexity.</p>
