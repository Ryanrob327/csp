<li>Problem:  description of a task that may or may not be able to be solved through the use of an algorithm.</li>
<li>Decision problem:  a problem with a binary answer (yes or no).</li>
<li>Optimization problem:  a problem with the objective of finding the BEST solution amongst many possibilities to solve a problem.</li>
<li>Decidable problem:  problem for which algorithms can be written to solve/produce a correct output for all possible inputs.</li>
<li>Undecidable problem:  These are problems for which no algorithms can be built that can provide a correct yes or no answer.</li>
</ul>

<li>An algorithm's efficiency is determine through formal or mathematical reasoning.</li>
<li>An algorithmâ€™s efficiency can be informally measured by determining the number of times a statement or group of statements executes.</li>
<li>Algorithms with a polynomial efficiency or slower (constant, linear, square, cube, etc.) are said to run in a reasonable amount of time. Algorithms with exponential or factorial efficiencies are examples of algorithms that run in an unreasonable amount of time.</li>
<li>Some problems cannot be solved in a reasonable amount of time because there is no efficient algorithm for solving them. In these cases, approximate solutions are sought.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="Hacks">Hacks<a class="anchor-link" href="#Hacks"> </a></h1><ol>
<li><p>Decidable problems are designed to produce an output for every possible input, and example is Linear Search. Undecidable problems cannot have algorithms be built that can produce a correct answer an example is a paradox.</p>
