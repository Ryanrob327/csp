<p>Q8 - Laptops being borrowed from a school library</p>
<ul>
  <li>My mistake was only selecting one answer when the question said there are multiple</li>
  <li>This can be fixed by reviewing my work after completing the test</li>
</ul>

<p>Q13 - old enough to drive but not to vote</p>
<ul>
  <li>My mistake was believing that the age could be greater than or equal to 16 when it was really just greater than 16</li>
  <li>To fix this problem I should spend more time thinking through the logic of my answers before submitting them</li>
</ul>

<p>Q28 - Robot in bottom right corner of grid</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once again my mistake was only selecting one answer when the question said there are multiple</li>
  <li>This can be fixed by reviewing my work after completing the test and reading the directions more attentively</li>
</ul>

<p>Q30 - use drawCircle to draw figure on a coordinate grid</p>
<ul>
  <li>Once again my mistake was only selecting one answer when the question said there are multiple</li>
  <li>This can be fixed by reviewing my work after completing the test and reading the directions more attentively</li>
</ul>

<p>Q42 - Car manufacturer simulations</p>
<ul>
  <li>this question had all options as correct, I did no think this was possible and because my knowledge of simulations is limited I only selected what I thought was correct</li>
  <li>from this question I have learned that college board will make trick questions to throw you off, and you must carefully review directions to ensure the questions are correct</li>
</ul>

<p>Q45 - Benefits of a heuristic solution</p>
<ul>
  <li>This problem asked questions about heuristic solutions which I am not entirely familiar with</li>
  <li>to fix this in the future I will do more review by creating a list of all topics on the test and going over them extra times</li>
</ul>

<p>The results of this test were decent but still worse than expected, my biggest problem is that I do not spend enough time to review my answers and think through the logic of my choices twice. However, on the AP test I will need to be able to answer these questions quickly. To accomplish this I will need to spend extra time studying the course material so that when the AP test comes around I will already be familiar with the types of questions and topics.</p>
