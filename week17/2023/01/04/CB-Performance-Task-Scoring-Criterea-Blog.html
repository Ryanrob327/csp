<ul>
  <li>To fulfill all CB requirements my program must include multiple examples of iteration, algorithms, procedure, and functionality in order to solve a problem or express innovation. In order to do this I need to rigorously test my code and review my written response myself along with other people to make sure I have met all standards and checked off all requirements of college board.</li>
