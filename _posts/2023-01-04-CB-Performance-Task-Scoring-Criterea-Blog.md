# Submissions
## Submission 1

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|0|0|Does not correctly describe program purpose, instead describes functionality|
|#2 Data Abstraction|1|1|meets all criteria, correctly describes two code segments |
|#3 Managing Complexity|0|0|could preferably say that the list could be replaced by return statements |
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|1|meets all criteria, with student produced procedure and description of functionality of the procedure|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|1|1|meets all criteria, includes detailed description of sequencing, selection, and iteration in the program|
|#6 Testing|1|1|meets all criteria, describes two calls with their conditions and procedures|


## Submission 2

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|1|1|meets all criteria, correctly describes the overall purpose, program functionality, input, and output|
|#2 Data Abstraction|1|1|meets all criteria, correctly describes two code segments |
|#3 Managing Complexity|1|1|meets all criteria, correctly describes the use of lists and how those lists improve the program|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|1|meets all criteria, with student produced procedure and description of functionality of the procedure|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|1|1|meets all criteria, includes detailed description of sequencing, selection, and iteration in the program|
|#6 Testing|1|1|meets all criteria, describes two calls with their conditions and procedures|


# Reflection

- To fulfill all CB requirements my program must include multiple examples of iteration, algorithms, procedure, and functionality in order to solve a problem or express innovation. In order to do this I need to rigorously test my code and review my written response myself along with other people to make sure I have met all standards and checked off all requirements of college board.
