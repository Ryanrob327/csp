# Project Plan

| Category | How my Project meets criteria |
|---|---|
|<b>Program Purpose and Function<b>|Website allows people to input their information to create a profile and match with other people|
|<b>Data Abstraction</b>|The backend framework stores data in dictionaries correlating to the type of information being stored which itself is stored in a larger list containing a dictionary for each individual|
|<b>Managing Complexity</b>|Data in the list is gathered when the user logs in by matching the inputted email and password with the emails and passwords of the stored data|
|<b>ProceduralAbstraction</b>|Many procedures are used to read, create, and update data, one example is the update display name function which allows the user to change their name in their profile|
|<b>Algorithm Implementation</b>|The match functionality of the program uses iteration to go through each user in the database and select users based on the personality quiz that they took|
|<b>Testing</b>|in the profile page you can edit your profile details by passing different parameters into a function, and in the sign up page you can create different details by passing in those parameters into a different function.|
