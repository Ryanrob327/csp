An application programming interface (API) is the medium by which different systems of software interact. In our applications we have two big systems:1. Python Backend that stores data beyond a single Web page2. GH Pages/Fastpages Frontend that is responsible for presenting data . To communicate data between Frontend and Backend, this section Backend code provides and interface to the Frontend using a Web Service Endpoint. Examples of endpoints are listed below and can be typed within a browser, which will return JSON data: . https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/2 | https://flask.nighthawkcodingsociety.com/api/jokes/random | . As you can see, these Endpoints return JSON. They are NOT that readable by normal humans. However, they are very effective in passing requested data across the Internet. The Frontend code is responsible for formatting and presenting and interface that allows the typical computer user to interact with this data. . The next cell of code is Creating Endpoints that return JSON. This allows developers in the Frontend to interact with Backend data. API is a contract between the Frontend and Backend on how to share data. . FYI, there is NO output from this section . . from flask import Blueprint, jsonify # jsonify creates an endpoint response object from flask_restful import Api, Resource # used for REST API building import requests # used for testing import random # Blueprints allow this code to be procedurally abstracted from main.py, meaning code is not all in one place app_api = Blueprint(&#39;api&#39;, __name__, url_prefix=&#39;/api/jokes&#39;) # endpoint prefix avoid redundantly typing /api/jokes over and over # API generator https://flask-restful.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html#id1 api = Api(app_api) class JokesAPI: # not implemented, this would be where we would allow creation of a new Joke class _Create(Resource): def post(self, joke): pass # getJokes() class _Read(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getJokes()) # getJoke(id) class _ReadID(Resource): def get(self, id): return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadRandom(Resource): def get(self): return jsonify(getRandomJoke()) # getRandomJoke() class _ReadCount(Resource): def get(self): count = countJokes() countMsg = {&#39;count&#39;: count} return jsonify(countMsg) # put method: addJokeHaHa class _UpdateLike(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeHaHa(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # put method: addJokeBooHoo class _UpdateJeer(Resource): def put(self, id): addJokeBooHoo(id) return jsonify(getJoke(id)) # building RESTapi interfaces, these routes are added to Web Server http://&lt;server&lt;/api/jokes api.add_resource(_Create, &#39;/create/&lt;string:joke&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_Read, &#39;/&#39;) # default, which returns all jokes api.add_resource(_ReadID, &#39;/&lt;int:id&gt;&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadRandom, &#39;/random&#39;) api.add_resource(_ReadCount, &#39;/count&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateLike, &#39;/like/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) api.add_resource(_UpdateJeer, &#39;/jeer/&lt;int:id&gt;/&#39;) . Frontend (View Simulation) and Hacks . This python codes tests endpoints on a server. This can be handy for development and testing when making modifications to the Jokes Web APIs. This code works off of the server endpoint/url, not from code cells above it in this notebook. . To work with this code and make observation for learning... .

Challenge . This code segment is at a very early stage of implementation. . What are some ways to (user) error proof this code? | The code should be able to calculate the cost of the meal of the user | . Hint: . write a “single” test describing an expectation of the program of the program | test - input burger, expect output of burger price | run the test, which should fail because the program lacks that feature | write “just enough” code, the simplest possible, to make the test pass | . Then repeat this process until you get program working like you want it to work. . menu = {&quot;burger&quot;: 3.99, &quot;fries&quot;: 1.99, &quot;drink&quot;: 0.99} total = 0 ordering = True #shows the user the menu and prompts them to select an item print(&quot;Menu&quot;) for k,v in menu.items(): print(k + &quot; $&quot; + str(v)) #why does v have &quot;str&quot; in front of it? while ordering == True: item = input(&quot;Please select an item from the menu or select &#39;done&#39;&quot;) print(item) if item == &quot;done&quot;: # checks if you are done with your order ordering = False elif item in menu: # checks if key exists in menu dictionary total += menu[item] # find any item from the dictionary and add its value to total else: print(&quot;input incorrect, please try again&quot;) # if you misspelled a word then you can re-enter the word #code should add the price of the menu items selected by the user print(&quot;your total: $&quot; + str(total)) . Menu burger $3.99 fries $1.99 drink $0.99 foot lettuce input incorrect, please try again burger drink done your total: $4.98 . Bugs/Errors . If you misspelled a word the program would encounter an error, I fixed this by adding an &quot;else&quot; statement that allows you to re-enter your order, I also had to google how to check if a key is in your dictionary to check if the key is correct. | For some reason if you order a burger fries and a drink you get charged $6.970000000000001 ## &quot;single&quot; tests | &quot;single&quot; tests on my own project I can isolate specific parts of my program and use print statements to isolate specific problems | .",

This problem was supposed to charge customers $5 per unit until they reach 25 units at which point it charges $7 per unit. I incorrectly chose an answer that only charged for units after the 25 marker. | . | This problem was supposed to set the score of a video game to 30 if time &gt; 120 and 50 otherwise Of the two answers I incorrectly chose one that set the answer to 50 regardless of the score by setting the score to 50 after the if statement. The correct answer is to set the score to 50 before the if statement. | . | This problem was supposed to append all even numbers under 10 to a list by iterating through a for loop My mistake was iterating(i + 1) before appending even numbers to the list rather than after. | . | This problem was supposed to switch values of two integers. I incorrectly chose the option that switches both variables to the same value as the first variable, this could have easily been avoided if I reviewed my answer. | . | This problem was the same as the last, it was supposed to switch the value of two strings. Same as before, I incorrectly chose the option that set both variables to the value of the first variable, I copied the same thought process as the previous question and did not review my answer. | . | This problem was about if else statements, by checking if certain numbers are greater than each other and adding or subtracting them. In this problem I did not take into account the changes made in the first if-else statement when I solved the second if statement, having a document or a piece of paper to keep these numbers stored would have helped me remember. | . | This problem iterated through i 5 times, adding i to the overall result every time I incorrectly chose that the result would be 6 because I thought the question was asking about the value of i | . | This problem took a first name and a last name and was supposed to return the initials using the concat() and Prefix() methods. I incorrectly switched the order of “prefix()” and “concat()” so that my answer would have only returned the initial of the last name, this was another silly mistake that could have been avoided if I reviewed my answer and took my time and the test. | . | Overview . In retrospect a lot of my mistakes were very simple and could have easily been prevented by taking more time and reviewing my answers. Although for the AP test since I don’t have much time I will also need to do more review. Almost all of my missed answers were on easy questions that I should have been able to answer in seconds I reviewed all of the college board material before hand. . For the final next trimester and the AP test I will be sure to review all college board material before taking the test and review all of my answers before submission. .",
