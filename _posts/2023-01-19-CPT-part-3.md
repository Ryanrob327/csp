# Submissions
## Submission 1

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|1|1|correctly demonstrates input, output, purpose, and functionality|
|#2 Data Abstraction|0|0|List is not accessed in code segment|
|#3 Managing Complexity|0|0|list does not manage complexity|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|0|0|does not specify how procedure connects to overall program|
|#5 Algorithm Implementation|1|1|explains in detail how algorithm works and demonstrates key ideas|
|#6 Testing|1|1|correctly identifies two calls and their conditions and results|

## Submission 2

|Reporting Category |Student Score |CB Score |Comments |
|#1 Program Purpose and Function|1|1|correctly demonstrates input, output, purpose, and functionality|
|#2 Data Abstraction|1|1|correctly identifies data being stored in a list, name of the list, and what the data represents in the program|
|#3 Managing Complexity|1|1|correctly demonstrates how program manages complexity and how it could be written differently without lists|
|#4 Procedural Abstraction|1|1|correctly demonstrates both code procedures and how the procedure connects to the program|

### Discrepancy
  - #6 -- I incorrectly thought the conditions being tested were the arguments in the rubric


# Reflection

Overall I think I need to be more strict, all of the discrepancies that I had with CB were from me being generous or not entirely reading the rubric. If I am harsher on myself when reviewing my work I am more likely to get a good grade. I also need to watch out for common mistakes like the program purpose describing functionality or incorrectly explaining how list manages program complexity.
