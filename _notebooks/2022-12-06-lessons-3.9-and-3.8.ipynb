    "Binary search is far quicker than sequential search because binary search inherently rules out half of the possibilities every iteration. Since you start at the middle index, you can either choose to pick the group that is greater than the middle index, or the group that is lower. As a result, you will rule out half of the known possibilities every single time you make a cut.\n",

First I would select the middle element ((1+5)/2 = 3, and for the purpose of collegeboard that is the middle element), and 16 is less than 36, so I would move back, (as the list is reversed). Hence, I would select the 2nd element ((1+3)/2 = 2) and that is equal to 36, so it would take me two tries in order to get to 36.\n",
